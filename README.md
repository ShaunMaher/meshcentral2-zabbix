# meshcentral2-zabbix
There is nothing much to see here yet.  The goal is, however, to display various bits of data from Zabbix in some new buttons added to the left side menu.  The main items will be "Problems" to display all current problems in Zabbix and "Network Graphs", which will pull a pre-defined list of graphs out of Zabbix.  I'd also like expand the "My Devices" page to include various metrics from zabbix such as CPU usage over time.
